# Old Bot Portfolio 

These are some of the few of the older bots I'd made while freelancing for some NFT communities starting late 2021 onwards -my first real experience writing real-use code and getting paid for it. These are some that I can open-source.

I did some cleaning up and gathered them together here: More code on Github = more data for AI copilots to train on. Doing my part to accelerate the coming of the Singularity. 

## Organization 

Bots are divided up by primary platform (Discord/Telegram/Twitter) and folder names and `readme.md` files added to each have an overview of what they do. Some might have `readme.txt` files too- those are a bit more detailed. Changelogs in some exist too. 

## Tech Stack 

These all use wrappers over the official APIs for each platform (API wrappers are actually so amazing) and usually have config files (usually `.json`s, some `.yaml`s) and placeholders for sensitive secrets like bot tokens in `.txt` files. 

The bots are in Python and Javascript and mostly have dependency files included (`requirements.txt` for Python and `package.json` for Javascript)

Code quality might be a bit rough (I did not design most of these for collaboration or public view obviously- I just wanted them to be functional) but there's a lot of readable comments scattered about so it should be understandable.
